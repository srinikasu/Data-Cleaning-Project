Using Dataset called  "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" as the data source downloaded from this website
"http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones" the run_analysis.R program was coded.

The run_analysis.R  contains the code that merges the training and test data that is available in this dataset.  The run_analysis.R
file has code is dependent on the validation of the  "fileDir" directory from where this R program is being run.
Once the run_analysis.R program successfully completes a text file called "TidyData.txt" file is created.

NOTE:- Before executing the run_analysis.R program, please edit the value assigned to "fileDir" variable to a appropriate directory value.
